Rocks on USB
============

This is a (under development) script which can copy a 
Rocks bootable iso on a USB stick and make the necessary 
modification so that the USB can be used to install the 
frontend (so you don't need the CDROM).

Most of the stuff are working now except when you get the 
browser error you should hit Alt+F2 and do the following 
steps:

- mount your usb drive under /mnt/cdrom
- cp /mnt/cdrom/rocks.conf /tmp
- start lightttpd with:
  /lighttpd/sbin/lighttpd -f /lighttpd/conf/lighttpd.conf

After that go back to the graphical windows Alt+F6 and then 
hit Ctrl+R and proceed with the rest of the installation.

Rember you have to do manual partitioning since the USB 
key could be seen as sda by your BIOS.
